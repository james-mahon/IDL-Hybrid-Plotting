# Hybrid Space Plasma plotting

## Simulation
This code will only read and plot the data provided by a simulation.  The simulation this code is based off of can be found here: https://github.com/pdelamere/Hybrid_3d_buf

## Organization
Paramaters are read in using Read_para.pro

Coordinates are read in and the grid is constructed using Read_coord.pro

Read_scalar and Read_vector read in particle data

Create_movie is the main program, created each frame and animates it

Other aspects still in development, subject to change
